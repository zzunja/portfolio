# Portfolio

Around Sophomore year of my college semester, I realized that I had done a lot of projects but it was all scattered about across many github repos and random files on my computer. At the same time, my friend kept talking about him making a Portfolio website and how I need to do the same. At the time, I didn't really think about it but that summer break I had a lot of free time on my hand and decided to make this website. 

# Idea and Goals
The main goal of this website was to have a easy to use website that I can easily create a new `.mdx` file and write about anything I wanted without having to add new code or anything. Simply just create a `.mdx` and write. I also wanted to fully code this website myself and not rely on templates like [Nextra](https://nextra.site/) or drag and drop components like [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/). Previously when making website, I used these as a way to mainly focus on the main goal of the website. This project though, I wanted to fully code it myself.

# Development
For this project, I decided on Next.js as that is what I usually use. The first step was making the layout. I wanted to make a simple design that was easy to instantly understand what the website is about the moment you see it.
